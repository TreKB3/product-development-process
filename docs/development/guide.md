## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (v8 or later) or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-development-process.git
   cd product-development-process
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use Git Flow for our branching strategy:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example:
```
feat(auth): add login form with validation

- Add form validation rules
- Implement error handling
- Add unit tests

Closes #123
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Define types for all props and state
- Use interfaces for public API and type aliases for internal types
- Avoid using `any` type

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use destructuring for props and state
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Follow the single responsibility principle

### File Structure

- Group by feature, not by file type
- One component per file
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Use `index.ts` files for cleaner imports

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for components
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Aim for good test coverage (80%+)

## API Integration

### Making API Calls

1. Create a service in `src/services/`
2. Use `createAsyncThunk` for async operations
3. Handle loading, success, and error states
4. Update the Redux store with the response

Example:
```typescript
// services/projectApi.ts
export const fetchProject = createAsyncThunk(
  'projects/fetchById',
  async (projectId: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/projects/${projectId}`);
    return await response.json();
  }
);
```

## State Management

### Redux Toolkit Patterns

- Use `createSlice` for reducer logic
- Use `createAsyncThunk` for async operations
- Use `createSelector` for derived data
- Normalize nested data
- Keep the state minimal

### Local State vs. Global State

- Use local state for UI state (e.g., form inputs, modals)
- Use Redux for application state that's shared across components

## Styling

### Material-UI

- Use the `sx` prop for one-off styles
- Use `styled` for reusable styled components
- Use the theme for consistent styling
- Follow the Material Design guidelines

### Responsive Design

- Use the `useTheme` and `useMediaQuery` hooks for responsive behavior
- Test on multiple screen sizes
- Use the `Grid` component for layouts

## Performance

### Optimization Techniques

- Use `React.memo` for expensive components
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for callback functions
- Implement code splitting
- Lazy load routes and heavy components

### Performance Monitoring

- Use React DevTools Profiler
- Monitor bundle size
- Check for unnecessary re-renders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Check for missing type definitions
   - Make sure all props are properly typed
   - Use type guards for complex types

2. **State Management**
   - Check Redux DevTools for state updates
   - Make sure actions are being dispatched correctly
   - Check for circular dependencies

3. **Styling Issues**
   - Check for CSS specificity issues
   - Make sure theme variables are properly defined
   - Use the MUI `sx` prop for debugging

### Getting Help

- Check the [issues](https://github.com/your-username/product-development-process/issues)
- Ask for help in the project's discussion forum
- Open a new issue if you find a bug
