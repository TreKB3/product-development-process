## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components**: Material-UI v7
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Version Control**: Git

## Application Structure

The application follows a feature-based folder structure:

```
src/
├── assets/               # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/          # Common components used across features
│   └── layout/          # Layout components (headers, footers, etc.)
├── features/             # Feature modules
│   ├── experience-map/   # Experience mapping feature
│   └── story-map/        # Story mapping feature
├── layouts/              # Layout components
├── pages/                # Page components
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── Projects.tsx
│   └── ...
├── services/             # API and service layer
├── store/                # Redux store configuration
│   ├── slices/           # Redux slices
│   └── store.ts          # Store configuration
├── types/                # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/                # Utility functions
```

## State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management with the following approach:

### Store Structure

- `projects`: Manages project-related state
- `experienceMap`: Handles experience mapping functionality
- `storyMap`: Manages story mapping features

### State Management Patterns

1. **Slices**: Each feature has its own slice that manages its state
2. **Selectors**: Memoized selectors for efficient data access
3. **Async Thunks**: For handling side effects and API calls
4. **Normalization**: Data is normalized to avoid duplication

## Routing

The application uses React Router v7 for client-side routing. Key routes include:

- `/` - Dashboard
- `/projects` - Project list
- `/projects/new` - Create new project
- `/projects/:id` - Project details
- `/projects/:id/edit` - Edit project
- `/experience-map` - Experience mapping board
- `/story-map` - Story mapping board

## Styling

- **Material-UI**: Component library with theming support
- **CSS-in-JS**: Styled components for component-specific styles
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints

## API Layer

The application currently uses mock data but is structured to easily integrate with a backend API:

- **Services**: API calls are abstracted into service modules
- **Interceptors**: For handling authentication and error handling
- **Mock Data**: For development and testing

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For utility functions and pure components
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: For critical user flows
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ test coverage

## Performance Considerations

1. **Code Splitting**: Routes are code-split for faster initial load
2. **Memoization**: Use of `React.memo` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. **Lazy Loading**: Components are lazy-loaded when possible
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring
5. **Optimistic UI**: For better perceived performance

## Future Improvements

- Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO and performance
- Add service worker for offline capabilities
- Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
- Add comprehensive error tracking and monitoring
- Implement comprehensive performance monitoring

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed as a static site with the following considerations:

- Environment variables for configuration
- Build optimizations for production
- CDN support for static assets
- Caching strategies for API responses
